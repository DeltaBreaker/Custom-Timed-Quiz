# Custom-Timed-Quiz
This is a small custom made knowledge test made with HTML, CSS, and JS. There are 6 questions about various topics of web development and a 60 second timer to answer them all. Answering progresses the quiz regardless of the result but an incorrect answer shortens the timer by 10 seconds. Making it to the end allows the user to save their score, persisting across reloading. 10 scores can be saved which are sorted from high to low.
